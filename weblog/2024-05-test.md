# This is a test post!!!!!!!!!!

I really appreciate what Microblog (MB) is doing. It is a fantastic corner of the internet, and I am happy to host my blog here for the forseeable future. The people here are interesting, funny and nice!

I've been using their full mastodon intergration for the last six months or so, and it was ok. It was made clear it isn't a full client, and that is certainly true. Your posts are sent out to the fediverse but MB doesn't show boosts, or likes so unless people reply it is almost impossible to know how your posts are doing.  You also don't get to see your follower count.

I thought I'd get over it but alas I couldn't. Today I migrated my MB masto account back to mastodon.org.uk.  Time to see how crossposting goes over the next six months!
